# Playbook 02 — First Product (Factory Test)

> The first product isn't about revenue. It's about **proving the factory works**. Revenue is the proof.

**Status:** Ready to Execute
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Depends on:** Research 11, Architecture 10

---

## Purpose

The first product is a **full-pipeline stress test**. Every stage of the revenue engine — scan → validate → build → launch → grow — must fire. We're testing:

1. Can we go from idea to deployed product in ≤7 days?
2. Can the product generate real revenue (even $1)?
3. Can we run the launch playbook end-to-end?
4. What breaks? Where are the bottlenecks?

**Constraint:** Buildable in one week. Real Stripe payments. Real users. Ship ugly.

---

## Three Options

### Option A: Niche API Service — "ReceiptParse"

**What:** OCR API that extracts structured data from receipt images. Upload photo → get JSON with merchant, date, items, total, tax, currency.

**Why it tests the pipeline:**
- Pure code, no UI beyond docs page — fastest to build
- Usage-based pricing exercises Stripe metered billing
- API marketplace distribution (RapidAPI) tests a channel
- Near-100% automatable post-launch

**Tech:** Cloudflare Workers + R2 (image storage) + Claude Vision API + Stripe usage billing
**Pricing:** Free tier (50 receipts/mo) → $19/mo (1,000) → $49/mo (5,000) → pay-per-call above
**Build time:** 2-3 days
**Launch channels:** RapidAPI listing, r/selfhosted, r/smallbusiness, dev Twitter, Indie Hackers
**Day 30 target:** 20 free users, 3 paid, $60+ MRR
**Total budget:** ~$150 (compute + domain + small promo)

**Strengths:** Fastest build, lowest risk, exercises metered billing
**Weaknesses:** Small TAM for receipts specifically, hard to differentiate from existing OCR APIs, developer-only audience limits learning about consumer distribution

---

### Option B: Micro-SaaS — "ShipPageHQ"

**What:** Instant landing page builder for indie hackers. Paste your product idea → AI generates a complete landing page with copy, design, waitlist form, and Stripe checkout. One click deploy to a subdomain.

**Why it tests the pipeline:**
- Full-stack SaaS (auth, billing, core feature, deploy infra)
- Tests the exact tech stack from Architecture 10 (Next.js + Supabase + Stripe + Vercel)
- The product itself is a tool we need for the factory's validation stage (Stage 2)
- Target audience (indie hackers) is our community — easy to reach, fast feedback
- Subscription billing exercises the standard revenue model

**Tech:** Next.js 14 + Supabase + Stripe + Vercel + Claude API for copy generation
**Pricing:** $19/mo (5 pages) → $49/mo (unlimited + custom domains)
**Build time:** 5-7 days (tightest of the three)
**Launch channels:** Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, r/SideProject, r/SaaS, Twitter build-in-public
**Day 30 target:** 50 signups, 10 paid, $200+ MRR
**Total budget:** ~$250 (compute + domain + PH launch)

**Strengths:** Exercises full stack, dogfoods our own validation pipeline, large audience, highest revenue ceiling, most learning about SaaS operations
**Weaknesses:** Most complex build, risk of scope creep, competitive space (Carrd, Framer)

---

### Option C: Digital Product + SEO — "PromptVault"

**What:** Curated library of tested, production-grade AI prompts for specific professional workflows (sales emails, legal summaries, financial analysis, code review). Browse free samples → buy packs ($9-29) or subscribe ($12/mo for full access).

**Tech:** Astro static site + Supabase (auth + content) + Stripe (one-time + subscription) + programmatic SEO pages per prompt
**Pricing:** Individual packs $9-29 + $12/mo all-access
**Build time:** 3-4 days
**Launch channels:** SEO (long-tail: "best ChatGPT prompt for [use case]"), r/ChatGPT, Twitter, Gumroad cross-listing
**Day 30 target:** 1,000 organic visits, 15 sales, $150+ revenue
**Total budget:** ~$100 (domain + hosting)

**Strengths:** Tests both one-time and subscription billing, builds SEO asset, lowest ongoing maintenance, content can be generated by agents
**Weaknesses:** Crowded prompt market, commoditizing fast, SEO takes months to compound, less technical pipeline validation

## Recommendation: Option B — ShipPageHQ

### Why

| Criteria | A (API) | **B (SaaS)** | C (Digital) |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Tests full pipeline | ◐ | **●** | ◐ |
| Exercises standard stack | ◐ | **●** | ○ |
| Revenue potential | ◐ | **●** | ◐ |
| Audience reachability | ◐ | **●** | ● |
| Dogfoods factory tools | ○ | **●** | ○ |
| Build risk (lower=better) | ● | **◐** | ● |
| Learning value | ◐ | **●** | ◐ |

**The decisive argument:** ShipPageHQ is the only option that **dogfoods the factory**. The revenue engine's Stage 2 (validation) needs landing pages fast. If we build a tool that generates landing pages, every future product we validate uses it. The first product literally makes the second product easier.

It's also the hardest of the three — which is the point. If the factory can ship a full-stack SaaS in a week, it can ship anything.

### Risk Mitigation

The main risk is scope creep. Counter with brutal constraints:

- **V1 scope:** AI generates page → user edits text → deploy to `yourname.shippages.com`. That's it.
- **NOT in V1:** Custom domains, analytics, A/B testing, templates, team accounts, drag-and-drop editor
- **Design:** Use a single clean template. AI fills in copy + colors. No design choices for user.
- **Auth:** Supabase magic link only. No passwords.
- **Billing:** One plan ($19/mo, 5 pages). No free tier. No annual pricing.

## Execution Plan

### Day 1 (Monday): Validate
- [ ] Build landing page for ShipPageHQ (use v0.dev or Framer)
- [ ] Post in r/SideProject, r/SaaS, Indie Hackers — "Building this, would you use it?"
- [ ] Set up waitlist (email capture via Supabase)
- [ ] Buy domain
- [ ] **Go/no-go gate:** 30+ waitlist signups by end of day → proceed

### Day 2: Foundation
- [ ] Init Next.js 14 repo, deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Supabase project: auth (magic link) + database schema
- [ ] Stripe product + subscription setup
- [ ] Basic layout: landing page, dashboard shell, auth flow

### Day 3: Core Engine
- [ ] Prompt engineering: "describe your product" → full landing page HTML/copy
- [ ] Page generation API endpoint (Claude API)
- [ ] Page renderer (server-side, clean template)
- [ ] User can generate and preview a page

### Day 4: Edit + Deploy
- [ ] Inline text editing (click to edit headline, description, features)
- [ ] Color/style customization (3 presets)
- [ ] Deploy page to `username.shippages.com` (Vercel wildcard subdomain)
- [ ] Published pages are live and accessible

### Day 5: Billing + Polish
- [ ] Stripe Checkout integration (subscribe to publish)
- [ ] Billing portal (manage subscription)
- [ ] Enforce 5-page limit
- [ ] Transactional emails via Resend (welcome, receipt)

### Day 6: Quality + Launch Prep

## Success Criteria

### For the Product
| Metric | Day 7 | Day 30 |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Signups | 30+ | 100+ |
| Paid subscribers | 1+ | 10+ |
| MRR | $19+ | $190+ |
| Pages generated | 50+ | 300+ |

### For the Factory (the real test)
| Question | Pass If |
|----------|---------|
| Can we build full-stack SaaS in a week? | Deployed and functional by Day 7 |
| Can we validate before building? | Waitlist data influenced go/no-go |
| Can we execute launch playbook? | Posted to 5+ channels on launch day |
| Can we process real payments? | At least 1 Stripe charge processed |
| Can we monitor autonomously? | Sentry + BetterStack + PostHog all firing |
| What broke? | Post-mortem written by Day 10 |

### Kill Criteria
- **Day 30:** <$50 MRR AND <30 signups → kill, try Option A
- **Day 60:** <$200 MRR → kill
- **Day 90:** <$500 MRR → kill

## Post-Mortem Template (Day 10)

Write to `/playbooks/02a-first-product-retro.md`:

1. **What shipped vs. what was planned**
2. **Timeline: actual vs. estimate per day**
3. **What broke in the pipeline** (the gold — this is why we're doing this)
4. **What tools/infra were missing**
5. **Factory improvements for Product #2**
6. **Revenue and metrics snapshot**
7. **Decision: continue, pivot, or kill**

---

## What This Unlocks

If ShipPageHQ works — even modestly — we've proven:
- The tech stack works (Next.js + Supabase + Stripe + Vercel)
- The build timeline is realistic (1 week for full SaaS)
- The launch playbook produces users
- The agent system can ship real products
- We have a tool for our own validation pipeline

Product #2 gets built faster. Product #3 faster still. The factory is real.
